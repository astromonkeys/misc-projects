# Patriots Vs Packers Choose Your Own Adventure
# Written by Bailey Conradt

R1:A Tricky Situation
The Patriots and the Packers were all geared up, ready to play in the Super Bowl. The game was going relatively well for the Patriotsâ€”that is, if you count losing by 7 to be "going well". With 1 minute to go in the 4th quarter and his team lined up by their own goal line, Tom Brady has some decision making to do.

What should Brady do?
;;;
: QB sneak -> 3
: Pass it to Gronk -> 4
: Give the ball to Sony Michel -> 11
: Kick a field goal -> 5
: Try a hail mary -> 6
: Forfeit the game -> 2

R2:Forfeiting the Game
Fearing what injuries and defeat lie in store for his team, Robert Kraft decides to forfeit the game to the Packers. It's a shame, it would have been fun to see Aaron Rodgers demolish their defense.
;;;
=)

R3:QB Sneak
Brady runs it for only a one yard gain. Maybe he should try throwing the ball instead.
;;;
: QB sneak Again-> 3
: Pass it to Gronk -> 4
: Give the ball to Sony Michel -> 11
: Kick a field goal -> 5
: Try a hail mary -> 6
: Forfeit the game -> 2


R4:Passing it to Gronk
As the only person on the team who can catch, Gronk actually reels in the ball.

What's Brady's next move?
;;;
: QB sneak -> 3
: Pass it to Gronk Again-> 10
: Give the ball to Sony Michel -> 11
: Kick a field goal -> 5
: Try a hail mary -> 6
: Forfeit the game -> 2

R5:Kicking a Field Goal
What were you thinking!? A field goal is only worth 3 points in football!

The Packers get the ball now, and they won't be going easy.
;;;
=(

R6:Try a Hail Mary
Knowing this is probably the only chance that he has to at least tie the Packers, Brady airs one out all the way to the end zone.
;;;
: -> 7 ? 1
: -> 8 ? 10
: -> 9 ? 10

R7:TOUCHDOWN
Against all odds, Brady somehow does it again! On the pass, however, Brady throws out his back from old age. 

Maybe he should just retire!
;;;
=)

R8:Intercepted!!!
As expected, the Packer defense grabs the ball and returns it for a touchdown.
;;;
=(

R9:Sacked!!!
Are you blind?! The Packers now have the ball on your 20 yard line.

Looks like this won't be a Patriots Super Bowl win after all.
;;;
=(

R10:Passing to Gronk Again
Brady tries passing to Gronk again, knowing that this guy is his best shot at getting any yards.
;;;
: -> 13 ? 1
: -> 4 ? 5
: -> 8 ? 4

R11:Running the Ball with Sony Michel
Michel runs the ball down the field for a 2 yard gain. You might want to consider getting a new running back (or at least playing one of your other 10 running backs)
;;;
: QB sneak -> 3
: Pass it to Gronk -> 4
: Give the ball to Sony Michel Again-> 11
: Kick a field goal -> 5
: Try a hail mary -> 6
: Forfeit the game -> 2

R13:Gronk Scores!
Once again, Brady doesn't have to do a thing as Gronk trucks a defender on his way to the end zone after a pass from 2 yards out.
